## Introduction

Using BioID-proximity-labelling approach and network propagation analysis, we identified a chromatin regulatory module in the functional network of TWIST1, a key molecular nexus in cranial neural crest cell (NCC) development. Genomic occupancy and transcriptome data of chromatin regulatory module members CHD7, CHD8 and WHSC1 suggested that they share roles in activating NCC-related neurogenic and cell migratory programs. Compound heterozygous loss of function mutants further revealed their dynamic expression and stage-specific functional cooperativity for NCC specification: In early ectoderm differentiation, the TWIST1-chromatin modifier module potentiates NCC fate in bipotent neural progenitors while repels SOX2-driven cortical neural stem cell fate. Later, TWIST1-CHD8 interaction maintains the ectomesenchymal potential in NC stem cells. Combined mutations of Twist1 and Chd8 in mouse embryos also led to malformation of craniofacial tissues. Altogether, our results have suggested a role of TWIST1 in pioneering the assembly of an epigenetic complex responsible in establishing the promoter/enhancer repertoires for NCC fate progression and ectomesenchymal potential. Our findings also suggests a common mechanism underlying the neural crest-related pathologies associated with TWIST1, CHD7, CHD8 and WHSC1.
